# Udacity-DAND-Project-6-Wine-Exploration

## Purpose
> The purpose of this program is to determine whether the explanatory variables residual sugar, perentage alcohol content, and acidity shared causal relationships with the wine quality ratings (on a scale of 1-10)

## Important File(s)
> **Project6_rmd_2.Rmd** is the R Markdown file that contains the program. **Project_html_2.html** is the html output of the program.

## Methodology
> The dataset for the analysis was assessed and cleaned by Udacity. I conduct univariate, bivariate, and mult-variate analyses to determine which wine factors to investigate. I also create a multi-linear regression in an attempt to find statistically significant causal relationships between my explanatory variables and the quality ratings.

## Findings
> While my regression model found seven factors that shared statistically significant causal relationships with the quality ratings, the r-squared statistic was 36.1%, which is not close enough to 100% to reveal any meaningful insight. Only if a model is created that explains almost 100% of the variance in the quality ratings and the factors still retain their statisitcal significance would I be able to confidentally say that the factors incluence the quality ratings.
